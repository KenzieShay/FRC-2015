# FRC-2015
Program for Team 4993's (Molten Steel's) robot for the 2015 game, Recycle Rush.

I am the only programmer on our team of 6 people, so i can use all of the help I can get! Please feel free to create a fork of my program, any suggestions on how I can improve are welcome. :smiley:

The program for our teams robot this year is in a different branch. I couldn't figure out how to put it on the main branch :P
Anyway, it's on the branch called SideBranch. Please take a look!
