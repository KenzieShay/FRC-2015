# FRC-2015
Program for Team 4993's (Molten Steel's) robot for the 2015 game, Recycle Rush.

So, I'm having problems with getting the robot's drive system to work. Whenever I hook up the joysticks, only one will ever do anything (and they aren't broken, 
I checked and if you switch the order, then the other one will work). Also when the wheels turn when I move the one joystick they react to,
the wheels spin in opposite directions (maybe this will automatically fix itself once I get the program to use both joysticks?).

Now I tried fixing these problems, and the drive station is giving me error messages, and wont even let me run my Robot Code.

PLEASE HELP!
